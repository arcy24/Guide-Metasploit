# Guide-Metasploit-Practical

### **Components of Metasploit**
- Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information 
or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. 

A payload in Metasploit refers to an exploit module. There are three different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: 
- Singles - Singles are payloads that are self-contained and completely standalone. A Single payload can be something as simple as adding a user to the target system 
or running calc.exe.These kinds of payloads are self-contained, so they can be caught with non-metasploit handlers such as netcat.
- Stagers - Stagers setup a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable. It is difficult to always do both of 
these well so the result is multiple similar stagers. Metasploit will use the best one when it can and fall back to a less-preferred one when necessary.
- Stages - Stages are payload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules. 
The various payload stages provide advanced features with no size limits such as Meterpreter, VNC Injection, and the iPhone ‘ipwn’ Shell.
